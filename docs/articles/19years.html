				<p class="corps">Vogue magazine, one of the most successful magazines to have ever been published, was created in 1892. The magazine has a total readership of 1,398,00 and is accessible to all ages. It is considered as one of the most influential publications in the world. Now owned by Conde Nast, the magazine is specialized in fashion and lifestyle for women and has 26 international editions. It is depicted as both a mirror and a shaper of modern life.</p>

								Vogue is a substantial window on the fashion industry and therefore is an indicator for global beauty standards. We decide to investigate 19 years of covers from the US edition. <br /><br /> On the left, the timeline spanning almost 2 decades from 2000 to 2018 is taking us through the variations of skin color representation and helping us comprehend the shift happening in the fashion industry. <br /><br />The century started with mostly white and tanned models represented on the covers and 10 years later only 2% of the models on the covers since 2000 were black. Even if this is far from rewriting the traditional diktats of fashion, diversity is appealing to fashion magazines, which do not hesitate to show clear improvements year after year. In 2018, the skin colors show to be more diverse with almost 20% of brown and black skin colors on the covers. Despite the awareness, there is a lack of diversity as most of the models have a white tanned skin color.<br /><br /> Vogue  clearly reflects a global trend in favor of tanned white skin and tends to not put forward the lightest and darkest ones as the fashion industry always used to do. With the rise of consumer activism and growing social media influence, the interactions between brands and consumers completely changed to give visibility to underrepresented communities. </div>

						Models on the covers as well as models on the runway have to represent all individuals and embrace diversity and difference unlike Hedi Slimane's show for the new Celine back in 2018 when reports stated that 91% of the models on the runway were white. <br /><br /> On the right side an illustration showing the evolution of the proportion of non-white models in the major Fashion Weeks. Clearly a lot has been made since 2016 as the proportion rose from 22 to almost 40% in 4 years. 	<br /><br /> Those figures may reflect a certain change of mentality but may also be a consequence of the economic pressure faced by brands. They need to capitalise on a broader and more diverse consumer base to face competition. Indeed, in a 2018 survey by Newscred, 90% of the respondants told them that using more diverse images helps a brand's reputation.</div>
