		<p class="corps texte">
			In 1904, German sociologist and philosopher Georg Simmel published an essay about fashion, not only about clothing but about the whole phenomenon affecting all modern societies. It is a cultural process integrating the individual and the economy. Fashion is about identity and a need for individuality favoring novelty. It is a way to establish social difference either by being “in”, indifferent or rejecting it. Any object, clothes, idea and habit can represent fashion according to Simmel. In essence, it is any field of social action where the process of individual formation and collective integration is conspicuous. It holds a strong cultural meaning behind it that is worth the analysis. The fashion industry, as we refer to on this website, is the global enterprise of making and selling clothes. Its market value is estimated at 3 trillion dollars which is 2% of the world’s GDP. Fashion involves each and every individual and has a powerful impact on our society and economy.

								Representation matters, we say. What we see on the covers of magazines, on TV screens and on the internet is a reflection of reality. Beauty, defined as a combination of shapes, colors or forms that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight, is portrayed in the fashion industry more than in other industries. It reflects, in a way, our society’s expected beauty standards. We know that beauty is undefined and yet, its definition resorted to maintain the European domination in terms of beauty standards. There is no need to call the others ugly when the exclusion and underrepresentation is sufficient to convey the message and to reproduce racist ideologies. Representation matters as cover of magazines aspire to picture and define beauty. In 2013, Naomi Campbell along with Iman and fashion activist Bethann Hardison formed the Diversity Coalition and launched a campaign to end racism on the runway. In an open letter to major fashion houses such as Chanel and Saint Laurent, they blasted them for casting only white models and contributing to racism. This was one of the first calls to action aiming at ending discriminations. More recently, events going from the Black Lives Matter protests, charges of cultural appropriation to outright racism shed the light more than ever on the fashion world issues. We decided to investigate on this topic by analyzing 18 years of Vogue covers from the US edition and focusing on colorism, one facet of discrimination.

			The Data 
		</div>
		<p class="corps texte">
			We downloaded the covers from The Vogue Archive website. We used the data from January 2000 to December 2018.
<br><br>
Then, we processed the covers with Python scripts following those steps:
<br><br>
- Identification of model faces by facial detection using the OpenCV library : we identified the region of the face and we cropped the images down to size.
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<img src="asset/images/homepage/i1.png" width="500"/>
</p>
<br><br>
- Identification of the skin tone and the lightness value : we fitted several k-means clustering models to. The clustering models varied in terms of which features were used (rgb and hsl color values) as well as how many clusters were formed (2 or 3). The script filtered out just the pixels that were determined by the computer model to contain skin, and calculated and stored the median rgb color, as well as the corresponding lightness value. The results of all of the valid clustering models were averaged together.
